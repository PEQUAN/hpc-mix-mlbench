09/29 14:25:04: Using the compiler: g++
09/29 14:25:04: We are working with 1 file and 44 different types
09/29 14:25:04: The expectation is 10 digits.
09/29 14:25:04: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
09/29 14:25:28: b) Check with highest format (Double)
09/29 14:25:31: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
09/29 14:27:46: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
09/29 14:28:18: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
09/29 14:28:21: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
09/29 14:28:21: The final result contains 34x double, 6x float and 4x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
