10/14 00:18:16: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
10/14 00:18:16: The expectation is 11 digits.
10/14 00:18:16: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/14 00:18:37: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/14 00:18:40: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/14 00:23:24: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/14 00:25:14: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/14 00:25:17: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/14 00:25:17: The final result contains 73x double, 10x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
