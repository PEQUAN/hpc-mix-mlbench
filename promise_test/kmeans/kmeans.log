07/16 17:37:59: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
07/16 17:37:59: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/16 17:37:59: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/16 17:38:03: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/16 17:38:04: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/16 17:39:51: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/16 17:40:56: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/16 17:40:57: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/16 17:40:57: The final result contains 24x double, 11x float and 31x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
