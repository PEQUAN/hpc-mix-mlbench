06/22 14:24:07: We are working with 1 file and 66 different types
06/22 14:24:07: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/22 14:24:07: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/22 14:24:11: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/22 14:24:12: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/22 14:26:11: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
06/22 14:28:12: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/Half
06/22 14:28:13: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
06/22 14:28:13: The final result contains 24x double, 31x float and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
