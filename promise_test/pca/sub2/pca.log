07/01 18:56:11: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/01 18:56:11: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/01 18:56:15: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/01 18:56:15: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/01 18:57:51: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/01 18:58:09: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/01 18:58:10: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/01 18:58:10: The final result contains 27x double, 5x float and 17x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
