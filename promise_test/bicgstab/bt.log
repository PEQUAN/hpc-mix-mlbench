04/07 02:21:54: Using the compiler: g++
04/07 02:21:54: We are working with 1 file and 48 different types
04/07 02:21:54: The expectation is 12 digits.
04/07 02:21:54: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
04/07 02:21:59: b) Check with highest format (Double)
04/07 02:22:01: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
04/07 02:22:03: The format float is enough for your expectation
04/07 02:22:03: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
04/07 02:24:56: e) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Half
04/07 02:25:00: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
04/07 02:25:00: The final result contains 41x float and 7x flx::floatx<8, 7>.
