06/30 16:44:35: Using the compiler: g++
06/30 16:44:35: We are working with 1 file and 17 different types
06/30 16:44:35: The expectation is 10 digits.
06/30 16:44:35: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
06/30 16:44:38: b) Check with highest format (Double)
06/30 16:44:39: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
06/30 16:45:21: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
06/30 16:45:22: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
06/30 16:45:22: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
06/30 16:45:23: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
06/30 16:45:23: The final result contains 16x double and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
