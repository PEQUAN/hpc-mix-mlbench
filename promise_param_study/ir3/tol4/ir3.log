10/13 23:05:53: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
10/13 23:05:53: The expectation is 11 digits.
10/13 23:05:53: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/13 23:06:14: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/13 23:06:17: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/13 23:11:08: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/13 23:12:53: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/13 23:12:56: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/13 23:12:56: The final result contains 73x double, 10x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
