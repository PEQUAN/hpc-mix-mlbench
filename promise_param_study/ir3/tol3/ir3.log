10/13 22:20:13: Using the compiler: g++
10/13 22:20:13: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
10/13 22:20:13: The expectation is 10 digits.
10/13 22:20:13: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/13 22:20:33: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/13 22:20:36: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/13 22:25:07: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/13 22:26:52: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/13 22:26:55: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/13 22:26:55: The final result contains 73x double, 10x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
