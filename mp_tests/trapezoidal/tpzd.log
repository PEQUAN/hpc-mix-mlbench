11/15 13:59:13: Using the compiler: g++
11/15 13:59:13: We are working with 1 file and 57 different types
11/15 13:59:13: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/15 13:59:13: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/15 13:59:15: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/15 13:59:16: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/15 14:01:12: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/15 14:01:12: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/15 14:01:12: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/15 14:01:13: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/15 14:01:13: The final result contains 43x double and 14x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
