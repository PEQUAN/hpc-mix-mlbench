07/23 16:31:58: Using the compiler: g++
07/23 16:31:58: We are working with 1 file and 27 different types
07/23 16:31:58: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/23 16:31:58: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/23 16:32:14: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/23 16:32:16: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/23 16:33:26: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/23 16:33:56: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/23 16:33:59: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/23 16:33:59: The final result contains 20x double, 5x float and 2x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
