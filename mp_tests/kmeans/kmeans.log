09/11 18:55:16: The expectation is 10 digits.
09/11 18:55:16: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
09/11 18:55:27: b) Check with highest format (Double)
09/11 18:55:29: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
09/11 18:56:46: d) Delta-Debug Half/Single
09/11 18:57:04: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/Half
09/11 18:57:07: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
09/11 18:57:07: The final result contains 20x double, 5x float and 2x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
