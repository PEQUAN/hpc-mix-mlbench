07/23 14:24:57: Using the compiler: g++
07/23 14:24:57: We are working with 1 file and 27 different types
07/23 14:24:57: The expectation is 10 digits.
07/23 14:24:57: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
07/23 14:25:00: b) Check with highest format (Double)
07/23 14:25:01: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
07/23 14:25:58: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
07/23 14:26:13: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
07/23 14:26:14: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
07/23 14:26:14: The final result contains 20x double, 5x float and 2x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
