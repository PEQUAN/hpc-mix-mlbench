11/19 11:20:40: Using the compiler: g++
11/19 11:20:40: We are working with 1 file and 32 different types
11/19 11:20:40: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/19 11:20:40: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/19 11:20:45: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/19 11:20:46: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/19 11:22:08: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/19 11:22:09: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:22:09: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/19 11:22:11: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:22:11: The final result contains 28x double and 4x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
11/19 11:22:11: It tooks 90.74s
