11/15 13:56:01: Using the compiler: g++
11/15 13:56:01: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/15 13:56:01: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/15 13:56:01: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/15 13:56:04: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/15 13:56:05: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/15 13:58:08: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/15 13:58:09: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/15 13:58:09: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/15 13:58:10: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/15 13:58:10: The final result contains 47x double and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
