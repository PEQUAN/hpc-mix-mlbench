09/18 19:46:17: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
09/18 19:46:32: b) Check with highest format (Double)
09/18 19:46:34: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
09/18 19:50:40: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
09/18 19:51:04: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
09/18 19:51:08: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
09/18 19:51:08: The final result contains 57x double, 1x float and 20x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
