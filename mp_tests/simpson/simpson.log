11/19 11:57:08: Using the compiler: g++
11/19 11:57:08: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/19 11:57:08: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/19 11:57:08: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/19 11:57:11: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/19 11:57:12: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/19 11:59:34: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/19 11:59:35: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:59:35: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/19 11:59:36: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:59:36: The final result contains 47x double and 11x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
