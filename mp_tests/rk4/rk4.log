11/21 15:58:50: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 15:58:50: We are working with 1 file and 46 different types
11/21 15:58:50: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 15:58:50: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 15:58:53: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 15:58:54: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 16:00:49: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 16:00:50: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/21 16:00:50: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/21 16:00:51: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/21 16:00:51: The final result contains 35x double and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
