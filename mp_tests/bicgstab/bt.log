10/20 19:11:18: We are working with 1 file and 114 different types
10/20 19:11:18: The expectation is 10 digits.
10/20 19:11:18: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/20 19:11:23: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/20 19:11:24: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/20 19:16:17: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/20 19:16:54: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/20 19:16:56: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/20 19:16:56: The final result contains 97x double, 3x float and 14x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
