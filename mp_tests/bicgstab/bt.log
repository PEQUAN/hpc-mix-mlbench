11/29 01:00:55: Using the compiler: g++
11/29 01:00:55: We are working with 1 file and 114 different types
11/29 01:00:55: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/29 01:00:55: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/29 01:00:59: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/29 01:01:01: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/29 01:06:17: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/29 01:06:54: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/29 01:06:56: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/29 01:06:56: The final result contains 97x double, 3x float and 14x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
