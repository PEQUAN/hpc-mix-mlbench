11/19 15:21:26: We are working with 1 file and 114 different types
11/19 15:21:26: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/19 15:21:26: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/19 15:21:30: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/19 15:21:32: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/19 15:26:33: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/19 15:27:09: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/19 15:27:11: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/19 15:27:11: The final result contains 97x double, 3x float and 14x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
