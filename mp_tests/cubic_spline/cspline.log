11/28 19:08:11: Using the compiler: g++
11/28 19:08:11: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/28 19:08:11: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/28 19:08:11: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/28 19:08:14: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/28 19:08:15: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/28 19:10:09: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/28 19:10:10: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/28 19:10:10: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/28 19:10:11: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/28 19:10:11: The final result contains 57x double and 1x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
