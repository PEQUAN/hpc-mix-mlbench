11/19 11:50:56: Using the compiler: g++
11/19 11:50:56: We are working with 1 file and 58 different types
11/19 11:50:56: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/19 11:50:56: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/19 11:50:59: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/19 11:51:00: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/19 11:52:58: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/19 11:52:58: The format flx::floatx<8, 7> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:52:58: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/19 11:52:59: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/19 11:52:59: The final result contains 57x double and 1x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
