12/02 23:39:48: Using the compiler: g++
12/02 23:39:48: We are working with 1 file and 92 different types
12/02 23:39:48: The expectation is 10 digits.
12/02 23:39:48: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
12/02 23:40:22: b) Check with highest format (Double)
12/02 23:40:29: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
12/02 23:48:05: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
12/02 23:52:32: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
12/02 23:52:38: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
12/02 23:52:38: The final result contains 68x double, 13x float and 11x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
