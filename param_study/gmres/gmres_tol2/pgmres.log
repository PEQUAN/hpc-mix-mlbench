11/22 05:15:13: We are working with 1 file and 86 different types
11/22 05:15:13: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/22 05:15:13: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/22 05:16:57: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/22 05:17:17: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/22 05:26:54: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/22 05:40:02: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/22 05:40:27: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/22 05:40:27: The final result contains 66x double, 13x float and 7x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
