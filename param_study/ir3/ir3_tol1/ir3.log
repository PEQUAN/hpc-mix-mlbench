11/29 09:14:38: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
11/29 09:14:38: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/29 09:14:38: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/29 09:14:48: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/29 09:14:49: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/29 09:19:09: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/29 09:20:14: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/29 09:20:16: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/29 09:20:16: The final result contains 73x double, 10x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
