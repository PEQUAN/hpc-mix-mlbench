11/17 03:46:41: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
11/17 03:46:41: The expectation is 11 digits.
11/17 03:46:41: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/17 03:46:51: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/17 03:46:53: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/17 03:50:59: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/17 03:52:04: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/17 03:52:05: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/17 03:52:05: The final result contains 74x double, 10x float and 12x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
