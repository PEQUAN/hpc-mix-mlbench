11/19 21:33:56: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
11/19 21:33:56: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/19 21:33:56: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/19 21:34:07: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/19 21:34:08: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/19 21:38:55: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/19 21:40:03: e) Delta-Debug custom(4, 3)/bfloat16
11/19 21:40:05: The format flx::floatx<4, 3> is enough for your expectation
11/19 21:40:05: The final result contains 73x double, 10x float and 13x flx::floatx<4, 3>.
