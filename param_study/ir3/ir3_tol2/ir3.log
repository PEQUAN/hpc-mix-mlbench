11/29 10:56:53: Using the compiler: g++
11/29 10:56:53: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
11/29 10:56:53: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/29 10:56:53: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/29 10:57:03: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/29 10:57:05: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/29 11:01:43: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/29 11:02:29: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/29 11:02:31: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/29 11:02:31: The final result contains 74x double, 9x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
