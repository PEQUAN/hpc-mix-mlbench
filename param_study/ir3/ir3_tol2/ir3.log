11/21 21:16:47: Using the compiler: g++
11/21 21:16:47: We are working with 1 file and 96 different types
11/21 21:16:47: The expectation is 10 digits.
11/21 21:16:47: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
11/21 21:16:57: b) Check with highest format (Double)
11/21 21:16:58: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
11/21 21:21:27: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
11/21 21:22:12: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
11/21 21:22:14: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
11/21 21:22:14: The final result contains 74x double, 9x float and 13x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
