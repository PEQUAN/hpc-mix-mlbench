10/20 20:56:29: We are working with 1 file and 86 different types
10/20 20:56:29: The expectation is 10 digits.
10/20 20:56:29: a) Get a reference result with cadna (double)
10/20 20:56:33: b) Check with highest format (Double)
10/20 20:56:34: c) Delta-Debug Single/Double
10/20 21:00:29: d) Delta-Debug bfloat16/Single
10/20 21:00:39: e) Delta-Debug custom(5, 2)/bfloat16
10/20 21:00:40: The format flx::floatx<5, 2> is enough for your expectation
10/20 21:00:40: The final result contains 77x double, 1x float and 8x flx::floatx<5, 2>.
